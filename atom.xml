    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While looking through all of my notes on git and github, I think
this post will be more of intro type stuff and later I&rsquo;ll get into
more complicated concepts. Here are a list of commands I find
most useful:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the basic and most important tools for new coders to
learn is the command line. It&rsquo;s how you talk to your computer to:
change directories, creating/delete files, locate a file, just
to name a few.</p>

<p>In class we are learning about the command line on this site:</p>

<p><a href"http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">The Command Line Crash Course</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to follow along and it has you run commands that
will be the most useful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the title suggests, it is yet indeed the first day of school for me. I am taking the DaVinci
Coder&rsquo;s course titled &ldquo;Building the Toolbelt of a Junior Ruby on Rails Developer.&rdquo; This class
is a full immersion RoR based training that lasts for a short 11 weeks.</p>

<p>Our first assignment was to get a blog up and running. The purpose of this blog is for
students to talk about their experiences throughout the class, what&rsquo;s being taught,
technical issues and any other information that will be helpful to refer to or perhaps help
someone else who is learning the same material.</p>

<p>Helpful programs to check out:</p>

<p>Evernote: Great for taking notes in class <br>
Anki: Flashcard application for quizzing yourself on definitions, topics, concepts, etc.. <br>
Github: A code sharing and publishing website <br>
Airparrot: Allows students to mirror their screen on to the class projector; helpful for solving problems that other students might be having too <br>
Moom: Lets you move and zoom windows easily all through the keyboard shortcuts</p>

<p>My goals for this blog is to: <br>
Keep it updated and blog about something after each class; <br>
Help others who might be learning from a beginning level; <br>
Be a great reference tool to track my progress and refer back to any questions
or problems I had. <br></p>

<br>


<p>Books that are helpful for a beginner learning RoR:</p>

<p>Learn to Program by: Chris Pine <br>
Beginning Ruby from Novice to Professional by: Peter Cooper</p>
